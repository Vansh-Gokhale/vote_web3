### ⚙️ Setup & Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Vansh-Gokhale/vote_web3.git
cd vote_web3

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Compile contracts
npx hardhat compile
```

---

### 🔐 .env File (Create in root)

```env
EDUCHAIN_RPC=https://rpc.educhain.testnet
PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key_without_0x
```

---

### 🚀 Deploy Smart Contract

```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network educhain
```

Once deployed, copy the **contract address** and update your frontend `index.html` or JS logic.

---

### 🌐 Connect to MetaMask

In the frontend JavaScript:

```js
const provider = new ethers.providers.Web3Provider(window.ethereum);
await provider.send("eth_requestAccounts", []);
const signer = provider.getSigner();
```

### 📦 To-Do / Future Enhancements

- [ ] Add real-time vote count updates
- [ ] Add NFT-based voter verification
- [ ] IPFS for decentralized frontend hosting
- [ ] DAO integration for proposal governance
